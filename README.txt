Instruction to run the program:

1. Navigate to the folder where 'py A1.py' belongs to
1. Type 'py A1.py' in the command line
2. You will be prompt to enter the gridsize and the threshold
3. Enter gridsize and threshold seprated by a comma (e.g 0.002,50)
4. A grid will be generated
5. To see the grid with crime rates close the current grid
6. To enter a path, close the current grid
7. You will be prompt to enter start and goal longitude and latitude
8. Enter the start longitude and latitude closest to atleast 3 decimal places seprated with a comma(e.g -73.5613,45.503)
9. Enter the goal longitude and latitude (e.g. -73.5527,45.4938)
10. A graph will be generated with an optimal path from start to goal
